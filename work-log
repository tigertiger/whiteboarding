-- Solve problem 1 non-recursively
-- Solve problem 2 non-recursively: ran into some syntax issues; spent some time playing in jsfiddle to figure out what wasn't working. --- Kept returning an empty array with:

let array = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];
  let singleArray = [];
function deduper(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++ ) {
    if ((singleArray.includes(array[i])) === false) {
      singleArray.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return singleArray;
}
console.log(singleArray);

-- Checked all the pieces singularly and it...should work?

Switched up if statement to: 
let array = [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53];
function deduper(array) {
  let singleArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++ ) {
    if (singleArray.includes(array[i])) {
      console.log(array[i]);
    } else {
      singleArray.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return singleArray;
}
