Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

// *hm, okay, well, I can get partway there by checking if i is <= i+1, but it leaves a bunch behind...and also...yeah, doesn't really work at all. :D
// What iffff I have 2 arrays? Does that help me somehow?
// If I compare the values in array1 to the values in array 2 and I use that to do the sorting? Does that solve the problem? Probably.
// So copyArray = array, and we go is array[i] <= copyArray[i]? If so, weeeee don't want to push it immediately, because...it might be bigger than a later number...so we want to mark it somehow? Or move it to the beginning? Can I move things? I'm sure I can. Reassigning and whathaveyou.
// I don't think I need 2 arrays for this.

// I will find the smolest item first

function sorter(array) {
    for(let i = 0; i <array.length; i++) {
        let smole = i;
        for(let test = i+1; test <array.length; test++) {
            if(array[test] < array[smole]) {
                smole = test;
            }
            return smole;
        }
    }
    console.log(smole);
}

// I have found the smolest. Now what do we do? Now we swip-swap. Oer & oer.

function sorter(array) {
  for(let i=0; i<array.length; i++) {
    let smolest = i; //say that first index is smallest, even if it's not
    for(let tester = i+1; tester < array.length; tester++) { //use every other index as tester to test against our supposed smallest
      if(array[tester] < array[smolest]) {
        smolest = tester; //if tester is smaller than current smallest, turn tester into smallest
      }
    }
    if (i != smolest) { // as we loop, if the index in question is not the current smallest, we:
      let nextBigger = array[i]; //save this index [as nextBigger]
      array[i] = array[smolest];
      array[smolest] = nextBigger;
    }
  }
  return array;
}

function sorter(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++) {
    let smolest = i; // decide first index is smallest, even if it's not
    for (let tester = i + 1; tester < array.length; tester++) { //set next index as tester index to compare with "smallest"
      if (array[tester] < array[smolest]) { //if tester is smaller than "smallest" then we turn tester into new "smallest"
        smolest = tester;
      }     
    }
    [array[i], array[smolest]] = [array[smolest], array[i]]; //as we go through swapping our smallest, we also literally swap their positions in the array, so that the smallest is leftermost.
  }
  return array;
}


// Now to try to solve it some other way...
// *reads all of the things recommended for reading about different sorts*
// I'll just stick with selection sort, ha ha

Old Garbage:

*function sorter(array) {
  let sortedArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++ ) {
    if (array[i] <= array[i + 1]) {
      sortedArray.push(array[i]);
    } else if (array === array[i]) {
      sortedArray.push(array[i]);
    }
  }
  return sortedArray;
}
